Hi! I'm John. I'm a PhD candidate in cognitive neuroscience. I think a lot about how neural geometry supports human behavior and experiences. I care deeply about how we can apply these principles to the classroom. These interests have left me with a very particular, somewhat non-sequitir set of skills and projects that I'd like to tell you about here.
